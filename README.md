### 👋 Welcome

I’m **Ira**, a 🎓 PhD student in **Computer Science** at Columbia University, advised by Prof. Baishakhi Ray and Prof. Gail Kaiser. I'm broadly interested in AI applications for code. 

- 🛡️ I've worked on AI for **security applications**, such as **vulnerability detection**.  
- 🐞 I've also explored **code reasoning for code-related tasks** -- specifically, investigating the techniques that underlie the ability of large language models to perform well on tasks like bug repair. 
- 🤖 I've also explored similar ideas in the context of **software engineering agents**, aiming to identify which components are critical for their performance and where future research should focus to improve agent capabilities.
